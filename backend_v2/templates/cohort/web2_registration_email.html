        <h1>Hello, {{name}}</h1>
        <p>We are happy to receive your application. At Web3bridge, our goal is to help you kickstart your journey into
            tech with the Web2 track of the cohort.</p>
        <p>Web3bridge Cohort XIII opens 1st of July, 2025, the onboarding to the cohort starts by 23rd of June, 2025 with the
            underlisted activities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grouping every participant</li>
            <li>Minting the token for discord onboarding which will be sent to the wallet address you submitted during
                registration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="warning">Make sure to double check and be sure the wallet adress submitted is an ERC20 address from
            Metamask or any other decentralized wallet service.</p>
        <p>If not, reach out to the admin to rectify it as soon as now! Remember to keep your wallet safe and protect
            your private key at all times.</p>
        <p>Do note that Discord onboarding will start from 23rd of June, 2025 to ensure that you and everyone in your
            cohort/group bond well before the cohort starts by 1st of July, 2025.</p>

                Do note that the payment made during registration covers only REGISTRATION and does not represent
                Tuition fee. </p>
            <p>This means we have the right to ensure that only those that are moving along with the class
                get to move past eviction week. Therefore, make all plans to ensure that you join the cohort and learn
                with the others.</p>
